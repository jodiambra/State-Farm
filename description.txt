Additionally, your executive summary should include which algorithm you think will perform better on the test set, and your support for that decision. Include an estimate of AUC for the test set for each model. Finally, describe how you would demonstrate to a business partner that one model is better than the other without using a scoring metric.
 
Step 5 - Submit your work: 
Your submission should consist of (a) all the code used for exploratory data analysis, cleaning, prepping, and modeling (text or pdf preferred—State Farm email will not accept .py files, for example); (b) the two results files (.csv format - each containing 10,000 decimal probabilities); and (c) your short report comparing the pros and cons of the two modeling techniques used (text or pdf preferred). Note: The results files should only include the column of probabilities.
 
Your work will be evaluated in the following areas:
• The appropriateness of the steps you took
• The complexity of your models
• The performance of each model on the test set (using AUC)
• The organization and readability of your code
• The write-up comparing the models
